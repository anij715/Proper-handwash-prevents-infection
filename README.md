# The Impact of Handwashing: A Historical Data Analysis

This project explores the groundbreaking work of Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis and the critical role of handwashing in preventing the spread of disease. By analyzing historical data from the 1840s, we demonstrate the dramatic reduction in mortality rates from childbed fever following the implementation of a simple handwashing protocol.

## ðŸ“– About the Project

In the 1840s, childbed fever was a deadly disease with mortality rates as high as 10% in some European hospitals. Dr. Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician, observed a significant difference in death rates between two clinics at the Vienna General Hospital. His investigation led him to a revolutionary conclusion: the contaminated hands of doctors were spreading the disease.

This project re-examines the data that led to this life-saving discovery, using modern data analysis techniques to highlight the profound impact of handwashing.

## ðŸ”¬ Project Analysis

The core of this project is a Jupyter Notebook that walks through the historical data and visualizes the impact of Dr. Semmelweis's intervention. The analysis includes:

* **Comparative Analysis:** A comparison of mortality rates between the two hospital clinics.
* **Time Series Analysis:** An examination of the death rates before and after the introduction of mandatory handwashing.
* **Statistical Significance:** A bootstrap analysis to determine the confidence interval of the reduction in deaths.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To explore the analysis yourself, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anij715/Proper-handwash-prevents-infection-master.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Proper-handwash-prevents-infection-master
    ```
3.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
4.  Open the `Impact of handwashing in preventing child fever in 1840s.ipynb` notebook to see the analysis.
